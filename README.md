# Super-Store-Sales-Analysis---Power-BI

It's a commonly known dataset called Super Store Sales Data.
From this data I have done my analysis on Power BI with data containing only Indian states.
I have added and removed columns as per requirement in data query and take the require data to data modelling for making visual insights.
I also set the cardinality relationship as per requirement for proper connections.
I have made three doughnut chart, three column chart, a line chart and some cards which helps to understand the visuals promptly.
